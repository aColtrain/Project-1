            <br>
            <p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 30px; margin: 0px 10px">Long ago Arlo roamed the earth with his family throughout Pangaea. Sadly, a meteor struck
earth and destroyed his family. He was left in a coma for millions of years and awoke in the 21st century.
He learned about the modern world and noticed it revolved around small cubes that humans were
addicted to. Arlo created a Twitter account to better assimilate in this new society. Arlo loves the
dinosaur content on twitter because it reminds him of the good days. He found out the humans have a
drawing trend where they draw dinosaurs like him during this “moon phase” November. He does not
like the space content on twitter though and isn’t afraid to be vocal about it. He hates meteors and
what they took from him. Arlo specifically watches for the tags #Dinosaurs, #dinosaur,
#DrawDinovember, #Space, #meteor. Since Arlo has been on twitter, he has gotten many likes and
replies from his tweets. Not only is Arlo learning more about the humans, he is spreading the good word
of the dinosaur to those who will listen!</p>
